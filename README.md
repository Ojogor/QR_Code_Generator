# QR_Code_Generator
QR_Code_Generator is a custom QR Code generator made in Python. Our effort is to create our QR code library. It is designed to be fast, free, and open source. 

In this project, the coordinate in a QR code is denoted by (y, x) instead of the convensional (x,y) because in the backend, the QR-code is implemented using multidimensional arrays.
